## Breif

The API will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on tasks. The tasks should have a title, description, and a flag for completion status.

Implement a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

```
GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.

GET /tasks/:id: Retrieve a single task by its ID.

POST /tasks: Create a new task.

PUT /tasks/:id: Update an existing task by its ID.

DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by its ID.
```
